Let's also add this text file to staging
you know the git commit -m followed by the message?
the message is just to tell the developer/guthub user what changes has been made to the file. This github commit -m seems to upload all the
files in the staging area to github and does not actually detect any files you put in the message

If I do git add . to this 'hello_world.txt' now which is 31 July 2025, will the date in github change from 2 years ago to today's date?

The git commit -m does not seems to upload the changes in the file to GitHub
